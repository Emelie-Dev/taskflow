<i>My name is Max.</i>

3
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,189
<i>My world is fire and blood.</i>

4
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,258
<i>Why are you hurting
these people?</i>

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,827
<i>- It's the oil, stupid.
- Oil wars.</i>

6
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,063
<i>- We are killing for guzzoline.
- Guzzoline.</i>

7
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:33,165
<i>The world is actually
running out of water.</i>

8
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,101
<i>Now there's the water wars.</i>

9
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,737
<i>Once, I was a cop,</i>

10
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,673
<i>a road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.</i>

11
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,509
<i>...To the terminal
freak-out point.</i>

12
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,512
<i>Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.</i>

13
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:48,247
<i>Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

14
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,715
<i>The earth is sour.</i>

15
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,383
<i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

16
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,118
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

17
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,221
<i>As the world fell,</i>

18
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,758
<i>each of us, in our own way,
was broken.</i>

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,295
<i>It was hard to know
who was more crazy...</i>

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,333
<i>...me or everyone else.</i>

21
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,138
<i>Hello?</i>

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,608
<i>Where are you?</i>

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,716
<i>- Where are you, Max?
- Max.</i>

24
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>Here they come again.
Max rockatansky.</i>

25
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,656
<i>Worming their way into
the black matter of my brain.</i>

26
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,825
<i>Help us, Max.
You promised to help us.</i>

27
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,163
<i>I tell myself...</i>

28
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,567
<i>...they cannot touch me.</i>

29
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,536
<i>They are long dead.</i>

30
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,430
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

31
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,270
After him!

32
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,274
After him!

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,180
Now!

34
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:47,733
<i>I am the one who runs from
both the living and the dead,</i>

35
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,502
<i>hunted by scavengers,</i>

36
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,439
<i>haunted by those
I could not protect.</i>

37
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:06,518
<i>So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

38
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:15,694
<i>A man reduced
to a single instinct...</i>

39
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,629
<i>Survive.</i>

40
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,677
Max?

41
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,811
Is that you?

42
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,813
Where were you?

43
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,417
Help us.
Where were you?

44
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,952
Help us, Max.
Where were you, Max?

45
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,220
Help us!

46
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,137
Help us, Max.

47
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,139
Stop running.

48
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,373
You let us die.

49
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,276
You let us die!

50
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,678
You let us die!

51
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,479
You promised to help us.

52
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,547
Why?

53
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,803
Witness!

54
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,689
We are war boys!

55
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,857
War boys! War boys!
War boys! War boys!

56
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,792
Kamakrazee war boys!

57
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,227
War boys! War boys!
War boys! War boys!

58
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,630
Fucacima kamakrazee war boys!

59
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,732
Hooked on!

60
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,035
Today we're headin'
to gas town!

61
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,937
Gas town! Gas town!
Gas town! Gas town!

62
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,640
Today we're haulin'
aqua cola.

63
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,142
Aqua cola! Aqua cola!
Aqua cola! Aqua cola!

64
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:52,577
Today we're haulin'
produce!

65
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,945
Produce! Produce!
Produce! Produce!

66
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,415
And today we're haulin'
mother's milk!

67
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,984
Mother's milk! Mother's milk!
Mother's milk! Mother's milk!

68
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,669
Rev it up
for the immortan Joe!

69
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,613
Once again,
we send off my war rig

70
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:05,116
to bring back guzzoline
from gas town

71
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,053
and bullets
from the bullet farm.

72
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:14,025
Once again,
I salute my imperator, furiosa!

73
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,796
And I salute
my half-life war boys

74
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,732
who will ride with me eternal

75
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,368
on the highways of Valhalla.

76
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,907
I am your redeemer!

77
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:36,909
It is by my hand you will rise
from the ashes of this world!

78
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,591
It's comin'.
G-get ready.

79
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:50,929
Yes. Yes. Yes.
It's comin'.

80
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:51,756
Do not, my friends,
become addicted to water.

81
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,725
It will take hold of you.

82
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,928
And you will resent
its absence.

83
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,489
Clear off!

84
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,858
Get 'em all off!

85
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,560
Clear off!

86
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:41,172
Signal gas town.
Convoy's on its way.

87
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,335
I got a war boy
runnin' on empty.

88
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,537
Hook up that full-life.

89
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,177
Hey! Careful.
That's a universal donor.

90
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,969
Boss, we're not going
to gas town?

91
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,340
Bullet farm?

92
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,145
We're heading east.

93
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,315
I'll pass it down the line.

94
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,217
New orders!

95
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,085
Thunder up!
Thunder up!

96
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,387
This is not a supply run!

97
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,757
Go. Go. Go.
Ace, what's going on?

98
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,625
We're heading east.
Why?

99
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,628
I don't know.
That's the order.

100
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,614
Moo.

101
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,448
Hey, pa.
Hm?

102
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,617
You know about this?

103
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,153
Your produce
ain't going to gas town.

104
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,098
She's gone off-road...

105
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,467
Into hostile territory.

106
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,403
Why would she
do that, dad?

107
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,339
Let me see.
Let me see.

108
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,874
Rictus.
I wanna see!

109
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:34,512
Rictus, go see
what's agitating dad!

110
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,708
Splendid!

111
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,977
Angharad!

112
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,154
Where are they?

113
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,323
They are not your property.

114
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,490
Miss giddy?

115
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,559
You cannot own
a human being.

116
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,029
Sooner or later
someone pushes back!

117
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,332
Where is she taking them?!

118
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:30,335
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go.

119
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,504
Where is she taking them?

120
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,406
A long way from you.

121
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,507
Aah!

122
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,634
Hey, what's happening?

123
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,638
Slit.

124
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,573
What's going on?
Slit!

125
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,242
Treason, betrayal,
an imperator gone rogue.

126
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,044
An imperator. Who?

127
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,412
Furiosa.

128
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,147
She took a lot of stuff
from immortan Joe.

129
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,149
W-what stuff?

130
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,150
Breeders.

131
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,584
His prize breeders.

132
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,353
He wants them back.
Not a hand laid on 'em.

133
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,530
By my deeds, I honor him.
V-8.

134
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,171
Oh!

135
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,343
That's my wheel.

136
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,345
I'm driving.

137
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,612
You're my lancer.

138
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,447
I just promoted myself.

139
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,083
Not today.
Today is my day.
Look at you!

140
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,152
If you can't stand up,
you can't do war!

141
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,420
He's right, son.

142
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,121
I'm not staying here
dying soft.

143
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,923
Ah, you're already
a corpse.

144
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,160
I just need a top-up,
some more juice.
There's no time!

145
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,028
We take my blood bag.

146
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,464
We take my blood bag and strap
him to the lancer's perch.

147
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,133
It's got a muzzle on it.
It's a raging feral.
That's right.

148
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,536
High-octane crazy blood
fillin' me up.

149
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,710
If I'm gonna die...

150
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:20,945
I'm gonna die historic
on the fury road.

151
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,853
Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,355
Organic.

153
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,622
Yeah?

154
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,824
Hitch up his blood bag.

155
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,292
Right-o.

156
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,067
Yeah!

157
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,903
Ah! How much more
can they take from me?

158
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,740
They've got my blood.
Now it's my car!

159
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,512
Immortan!

160
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,381
Immortan Joe!

161
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,750
Ah!

162
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,719
He looked at me!

163
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,354
He looked right at me!

164
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,289
He looked at your blood bag!

165
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,390
He turned his head.

166
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,792
He looked me
straight in the eye.

167
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,194
He was scanning the horizon.

168
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,896
No.

169
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,097
I am awaited.

170
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,833
I am awaited in Valhalla!

171
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,337
<i>Confucamus!</i>

172
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,809
Immortan!

173
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,344
Yeah!

174
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,631
Hey! Heads up!

175
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,033
Heads up!

176
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,272
Boss!

177
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,941
We got vehicles
from the citadel.

178
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,409
They're firing flares.

179
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,244
They want reinforcements

180
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,012
from gas town
and the bullet farm.

181
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,014
What is this?

182
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,582
Backup? Decoy?

183
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,551
It's a detour.

184
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,684
Eyes right.

185
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:18,055
Buzzards!

186
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,123
Buzzards right!

187
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,224
Eyes on! Eyes on!

188
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,292
Buzzards right!

189
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,560
Eyes on!

190
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,061
Eyes on! Yeah!

191
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:29,066
Should we turn it 'round
and run 'em into our backup?

192
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,636
No. We're good.

193
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,838
We fang it!

194
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:41,012
Thunder up!
Here we go!

195
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,248
Prepare the gunners!

196
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,111
Morsov!

197
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,184
Come on, attack!

198
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,765
War!

199
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,540
Ready!

200
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,286
She's ours, slit!

201
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,520
She's ours.

202
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,622
First, we get the buzzards
off her back!

203
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,195
Form up!

204
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,001
That's my head!

205
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,110
Aah!

206
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,515
Aah! Aah!

207
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,739
Get up!
You can do it!

208
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,578
Morsov!

209
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
Morsov!

210
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:30,582
No!

211
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,184
Witness me!

212
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,553
Witness!
Witness!

213
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,264
Witness!

214
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,835
Mediocre, morsov!

215
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,304
Mediocre!
Aah!

216
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,958
Ready!

217
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,835
Get ready!

218
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:27,671
Back me in!

219
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,043
They're coming!

220
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,154
Ah!

221
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:52,163
We can't breathe down there!

222
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,898
Stay out of sight!

223
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,233
Now!

224
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,637
Aah!

225
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:09,480
Go back!

226
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,250
Hydraulics!
Hydraulics!

227
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,641
Yeah.

228
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:44,014
Now we bring home
the Booty.

229
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,120
Aah!

230
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,476
She thinks she can lose us, dad.

231
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,512
She thinks we're stupid.

232
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,381
She thinks she can lose us
in there!

233
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,834
Fang it!

234
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,836
Fang it!

235
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,910
Why can't you stop?

236
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,745
Crew!

237
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,914
Outta the way!
Out of the way!

238
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,382
What have you done?

239
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,750
What have you done?!

240
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,900
We need counterweight.
Get the blood bag down the back.

241
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,554
Hunt them down!
Hunt them down!

242
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,545
Aah!

243
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,147
Hey, head...

244
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,616
Say bye-bye
to the neck!

245
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,817
<i>Decapito!</i>

246
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,218
We're goin' in, slit!

247
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:06,150
Come on!
We've almost got her!

248
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,326
Come on!
Hold it steady!

249
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,819
Aah!

250
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,189
Oh, what a day!

251
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,124
What a lovely day!

252
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,579
I am the man...

253
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,947
Who grabs the sun...

254
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:16,053
...riding to Valhalla!

255
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:19,656
Witness me, blood bag!

256
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,129
Witness!

257
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,821
I live, I die,
I live again!

258
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,278
We're not going back.

259
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:04,775
Water.

260
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,654
Ahh.

261
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:58,462
Ah.

262
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,631
You.

263
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,349
Angharad,
is that just the wind,

264
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,085
or is it a furious vexation?

265
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,109
I got it!

266
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,521
Aah!

267
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:37,287
Glory me, blood bag!
We snagged her alive.

268
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,722
He's gonna shred her.

269
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,156
Shred her!

270
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,925
Bolt cutters.

271
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,628
Chain.

272
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,895
Hey, hey!

273
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,167
Oh, look at them.

274
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,236
So shiny,
so chrome.

275
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,739
He's gonna be so grateful.

276
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:59,009
We could ask for anything.

277
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:01,011
I wanna drive the war rig.

278
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:03,079
What are you gonna ask for?

279
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,314
That's my jacket.

280
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:05,815
Sure.

281
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,518
I mean, you can ask
for more than a jacket.

282
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,153
We're going
to the green place.

283
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,055
Wait, it's you and me.

284
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:28,104
We're going to the green place
of many mothers.

285
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,857
How does it feel?

286
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,025
It hurts.

287
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,728
Out here,
everything hurts.

288
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,298
You wanna get through this?

289
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,036
Do as I say.

290
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,277
Now pick up what you can
and run.

291
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,321
Kill switches.

292
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,424
I set the sequence myself.

293
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,626
This rig goes nowhere
without me.

294
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:02,232
You can get in.

295
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,534
Not without them.

296
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,478
So we wait.

297
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:25,488
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

298
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,056
You've already damaged
one of his wives.

299
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,691
How grateful
do you think he's gonna be?

300
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,267
You're sitting
on 2,000 horsepower

301
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,968
of nitro-boosted
war machine.

302
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,173
I'd say you've got
about a five-minute head start.

303
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:52,148
You want that thing
off your face?

304
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,029
Let's go.

305
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,011
Uh-uh-uh.

306
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,307
Of all the legs
you had to shoot,

307
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,077
that one was attached
to his favorite.

308
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,765
Smeg!

309
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:37,287
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

310
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:38,588
What choice does she have?

311
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,356
He's not gonna hurt us.
He needs us.

312
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,524
Why?
To bargain.

313
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:43,526
Oh, he'll hurt us,
all right.

314
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:46,095
Do you think
he's coming to the green place?
Never!

315
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:47,931
He's a crazy smeg
who eats<i> schlanger!</i>

316
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:15,758
Ah, stay out of there.

317
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,060
Behind you.

318
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:18,861
Huh?

319
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:23,333
The gas town boys.

320
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:27,337
Don't damage the good.

321
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:34,978
What do you see?

322
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:39,782
Big rigs.

323
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,151
Polecats.

324
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,587
Flamers.

325
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:47,957
And there's
the people eater himself.

326
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,160
Coming to count the cost.

327
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:52,362
Hm.

328
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,540
Aah!

329
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,178
We're dragging something
out back.

330
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,947
I think it's the fuel pod.

331
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,649
No, no.

332
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,884
I'll go.

333
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,636
Filth!
You traited him!

334
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:46,275
No unnecessary killing!

335
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:47,744
This war boy
wants me dead!

336
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:48,746
We agreed!

337
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,280
He's kamakrazee!

338
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,783
He's just a kid
at the end of his half-life.

339
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:56,652
No! I live, I die,
I live again!

340
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:57,920
Hold him!
Tie him up!

341
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,455
Get off him.
Throw him out!

342
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,057
Chuck him out.

343
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,926
You got more friends.

344
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,730
Bullet farmer.

345
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:09,999
They're coming from the bullet farm.
Yeah?

346
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,235
It's over.
You can't defy him.

347
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:14,437
Just watch us, mate.

348
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,938
He is the one
who grabbed the sun.

349
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,673
Look at how slick
he's fooled you, war boy!

350
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,475
He's a lying old man.

351
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:20,943
By his hand,
we'll be lifted up!

352
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,346
That's why we have his logo
seared on our backs!

353
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:25,248
"Breeding stock!"
"Battle fodder!"

354
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,951
No, I am awaited!
You're an old man's battle fodder!

355
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,020
Killing everyone and everything!
We're not to blame!

356
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,189
Then who killed the world?

357
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:02,685
I made a deal up ahead.
Safe passage.

358
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:05,855
I don't know
if it's still any good.

359
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:07,190
Get back in the hold!

360
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:10,526
Keep the hatch open.

361
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:17,233
I need you here.

362
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:21,070
You may have to drive
the rig.

363
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:27,276
You.

364
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:29,712
You stay.

365
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:33,482
You stay there.

366
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,020
Whatever you do,
you can't be seen.

367
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,824
I'm supposed to be alone.
That was the deal.

368
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,765
Down here.

369
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,287
Hey.

370
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,589
What's your name?

371
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:16,459
What do I call you?

372
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:19,061
Does it matter?

373
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,265
Fine.

374
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,200
When I yell "fool,"

375
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:26,702
you drive out of here
as fast as you can.

376
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,473
This is the sequence...
One.

377
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:32,308
One, two.

378
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,110
One.

379
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:36,646
Red, black, go.

380
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:38,781
You have it?

381
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,868
It's all here!

382
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,337
Three thousand gallons
of guzzoline,

383
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,805
just like you asked!

384
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,544
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

385
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:20,349
You drop the rocks.

386
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:30,659
You said,
"a few vehicles in pursuit.

387
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,561
Maybe."

388
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:35,431
We count
three war parties!

389
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:38,034
Yeah, well,
I got unlucky.

390
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,568
Let's do this!

391
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,263
Fool!

392
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,505
That's our fuel!

393
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:06,856
Make way for the ripsaw!

394
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:24,173
Once I'm over, clear the rocks

395
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,275
and bring everyone through.

396
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,611
Immortan!
Immortan Joe!

397
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:31,847
I got a war boy!
Says he was on the war rig!

398
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,385
You! Climb aboard!

399
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:39,855
Hey! Hey!

400
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,124
I got his boot!

401
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:45,161
I got the blood bag's boot!

402
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,228
Take me!

403
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,731
I got his boot!

404
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:52,701
All this
for a family squabble.

405
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:55,804
Healthy babies.

406
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,466
Reload the clip.

407
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,035
I-I can't.

408
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,611
Gun!

409
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:17,279
Give the gun!
It's not loaded yet!

410
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,213
You!
Now!

411
00:55:18,215 --> 00:55:19,415
We had a deal!

412
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:00,989
Aah!

413
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,496
Aah!

414
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:09,598
Rictus!

415
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,999
The wives!

416
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,501
No more flames.

417
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,542
Splendid!

418
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,111
Splendid!

419
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:23,278
That's my child!

420
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,914
My property!

421
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:28,817
Immorta...

422
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:42,464
Immortan, if I get on the rig,
there's a way inside.

423
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:44,266
What is your name?
It's nux.

424
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:47,302
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing for ya.

425
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:48,604
No.

426
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:51,540
Put a bullet in her skull,
stop the rig,

427
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:53,375
return my treasures to me,

428
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:56,078
and I myself
will carry you

429
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,481
to the gates of Valhalla.

430
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,949
Am I awaited?

431
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:07,055
You will ride eternal...
Shiny and chrome.

432
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:08,490
Rictus!

433
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:11,293
Help him aboard!

434
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,895
Ready?

435
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:15,130
Here we go!

436
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:29,645
Mediocre!

437
00:57:58,776 --> 00:57:59,908
<i>Schlanger!</i>

438
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:05,681
Aah!

439
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:21,630
Look out!

440
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:26,168
Angharad!

441
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,270
Get out!

442
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:50,826
No!
Angharad!

443
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,943
Stop!
Turn the rig around!

444
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,012
Go back for her!

445
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:11,680
No.

446
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:14,082
Tell him
to turn the rig around!

447
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,584
Did you see it?

448
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:18,053
She went under the wheels.

449
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,689
Did you see it?

450
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:23,091
She went
under the wheels.

451
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,127
We keep moving.

452
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:26,562
No!
We keep moving!

453
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:29,097
He doesn't know
what he's talking about!

454
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:31,466
Whatever happens,
we're going to the green place.

455
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:32,734
The stupid green place.

456
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,469
We don't even know
where to find it.

457
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:47,749
You all right?

458
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,319
On! On!

459
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:28,857
Cheedo!

460
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,792
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

461
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,428
Stop! He'll forgive us.
I know he will.

462
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,030
There is no going back!

463
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,865
We were his treasures!

464
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,500
Cheedo!
We were protected.

465
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:40,102
He gave us the high life.

466
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:42,037
What wrong with that?
We are not things.

467
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:44,107
No!

468
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,775
Cheedo,
we are not things!

469
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:48,010
We are not things.

470
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:49,978
I don't want to hear
that again!

471
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,179
They were her words!

472
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:53,615
And now she's dead!

473
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,183
Wring your hands.

474
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:59,121
You're not going back
to him.

475
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:00,123
Angharad!

476
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:01,890
Come on!
Come on!

477
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:20,242
So, um...

478
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:25,147
Where is this...

479
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:27,649
This green place?

480
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:30,252
It's a long night's run,
heading east.

481
01:01:30,254 --> 01:01:31,887
Hm.

482
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,388
We need inventory.

483
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,591
I want you to match every gun
with its bullets.

484
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,230
I'm gonna go down
and do some repairs.

485
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,865
We need someone
down the back.

486
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,834
I'll go.
No.

487
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,070
I want you
to stay together.

488
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:50,105
I can do it.

489
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,972
What are you doing here?

490
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:28,710
He saw it.
He saw it all.

491
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:32,614
My own blood bag
drivin' the rig that killed her.

492
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,556
Stop doing that.

493
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,960
Shh, shh, shh.

494
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,228
Stop.

495
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,174
Thr... three times
the gates were open to me.

496
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:00,442
What gates?

497
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,177
I was awaited in Valhalla.

498
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:03,945
They were calling my name.

499
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,515
I should be walking
with the immorta,

500
01:03:06,517 --> 01:03:09,351
mcfeasting with the heroes
of all time.

501
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:16,324
I'd say it was
your manifest Destiny not to.

502
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:20,662
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

503
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:23,832
I got to drive
a pursuit vehicle.

504
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:28,270
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

505
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:30,005
Who are Larry and Barry?

506
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:31,773
My mates.

507
01:03:31,775 --> 01:03:34,342
Larry and Barry.

508
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:39,614
If they don't get me,
then the night fevers will.

509
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:05,240
Well, we've only got four
for big boy here,

510
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:06,875
so he's all but useless.

511
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:11,746
But we can squirt off
this little pinky

512
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:14,816
a raunchy 29 times.

513
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:18,220
Angharad used to call them
antiseed.

514
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:23,058
Plant one
and watch something die.

515
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:59,854
We are down
30,000 units of guzzoline,

516
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:03,591
19 canisters of nitro,
12 assault bikes,

517
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,327
7 pursuit vehicles.

518
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:06,861
The deficit mounts.

519
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:11,433
And now, sir, you have us
stuck in a quagmire.

520
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,368
Hey, Joe!

521
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,437
Boss!

522
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:19,107
Your girly's breathing her last!

523
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:21,509
What about the child?

524
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,187
Are ya comin', brother?

525
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:33,455
Wait!

526
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:36,825
It's gone awful quiet
in there.

527
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,226
Get it out.

528
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:39,761
Get it out!

529
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,632
Come on!
I've been called to the torture!

530
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,368
Patience!

531
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:50,705
Oh, you stay here
with your grief, daddy.

532
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,040
I'll fetch 'em for ya.

533
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,109
Be careful!
Protect the assets!

534
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:59,481
Just one angry shot...

535
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:01,149
For furiosa.

536
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:02,217
Hut!

537
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:12,327
Cryin' shame.

538
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:13,495
Come.

539
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:15,830
Nother month...

540
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:18,867
Could've been
your viable human.

541
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,268
Was it a male?

542
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,070
Your a-one Alpha prime.

543
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,707
Hey, rictus!

544
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:26,941
Huh?

545
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:29,244
You lost a baby brother.

546
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:35,350
Perfect in every way.

547
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:37,552
I had a baby brother!

548
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,355
I had a little baby brother!

549
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:42,390
And he was perfect!

550
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,692
Perfect in every way!

551
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,658
Come on.

552
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:28,103
Wouldn't wanna shoot
the wives, sir.

553
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:29,137
Just probing.

554
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,950
He wants to help!

555
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:42,984
Who?!

556
01:08:42,986 --> 01:08:44,619
The war boy!

557
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,321
Where did he come from?!

558
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:48,923
I thought we threw him
off the rig!

559
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:54,429
T-there's high ground
just beyond that thing.

560
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:55,431
He means the tree.

561
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:57,866
Yeah. Tree!

562
01:08:57,868 --> 01:08:59,200
Leave him to me.

563
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:01,369
Say, anyone notice
that bright light?

564
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,538
Encroaching gunfire?

565
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:06,174
Get out.
I-I can do this.
I know this machine.

566
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:07,942
He does.
He's a revhead.

567
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:14,549
You've got two left.

568
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,789
On him.

569
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:41,309
Don't breathe.

570
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:43,578
Aah!

571
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:45,880
Hey!

572
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:48,716
Hey! Hey!
War boy!

573
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,519
I'm gonna use the winch
'round the tree thing!

574
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:55,657
Take this.
Let's get the engine plates.

575
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,825
You drive the rig!

576
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:59,827
Hold up a flare.
I am holding a flare!

577
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,029
Closer.

578
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:03,765
It's right in front
of your eyes!

579
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:16,811
Hut! Hut!!

580
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:24,652
Blood bag!

581
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:33,461
I am the scales of justice!

582
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:36,331
Conductor of the choir
of death!

583
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,470
Sing, brother koch!

584
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:47,542
Sing, brothers, sing!

585
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:48,943
Sing!

586
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:51,145
Don't they know
they're shooting at us?

587
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:09,631
Gun fever!

588
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:19,901
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

589
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:22,136
How are the engines?

590
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:24,038
Very hot and real thirsty.

591
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:29,711
Hey.

592
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:33,081
You need to take the war rig
half a click down the track.

593
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:34,482
What if you're not back

594
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:36,818
by the time
the engines have cooled?

595
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,722
Well, you keep moving.

596
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,233
What do you suppose
he's gonna do?

597
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:55,103
Retaliate first.

598
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,240
Let's go!

599
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:42,350
Oh.

600
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,588
Are you hurt?

601
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,823
Huh?

602
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:23,257
You're bleeding.

603
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:25,460
That's not his blood.

604
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:29,330
What is this?

605
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:30,731
It's mother's milk.

606
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,342
It's okay.

607
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:15,643
Sleep.

608
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:18,079
Get some rest.

609
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:32,059
How do you know
this place even exists?

610
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:35,596
I was born there.

611
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:38,900
So why'd you leave?

612
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:41,202
I didn't.

613
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:44,071
I was taken as a child.

614
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,308
Stolen.

615
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:55,182
You done this before?

616
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:56,717
Many times.

617
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,588
Now that I drive
a war rig...

618
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,724
This is the best shot
I'll ever have.

619
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,027
And them?

620
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:09,897
They're looking for hope.

621
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,166
What about you?

622
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:18,506
Redemption.

623
01:17:01,484 --> 01:17:04,552
Hey, what's that?

624
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:20,568
I remember something like that.

625
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:33,981
Help me!

626
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:40,054
Help me!

627
01:17:40,056 --> 01:17:42,623
Help me, please!
Uh-oh.

628
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:43,991
Please!

629
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,893
That's bait.

630
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,763
Stay in the rig.

631
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:58,139
Hurry! Please, hurry!
They'll be back!

632
01:17:58,141 --> 01:18:01,575
I am one of the vuvalini!

633
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:04,145
Of the many mothers!

634
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:08,249
My initiate mother
was k.T. Concannon!

635
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:12,053
I am the daughter
of Mary jabassa.

636
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:16,991
My clan was swaddle dog!

637
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:04,638
It's me.

638
01:19:11,948 --> 01:19:14,381
There's something
in the eyes.

639
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:17,451
Perhaps it is jabassa's child.

640
01:19:21,991 --> 01:19:24,024
This is our furiosa.

641
01:19:26,162 --> 01:19:27,928
How long has it been?

642
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,931
7,000 days.

643
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:34,769
Plus the ones
I don't remember.

644
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:36,137
Furiosa.

645
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:39,173
What happened to your mother?

646
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:42,576
She died.

647
01:19:42,578 --> 01:19:44,345
On the third day.

648
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:52,686
From where did you come?

649
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:54,655
The west. Citadel.

650
01:19:54,657 --> 01:19:56,991
Beyond the mountains.

651
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:02,830
The men...
Who are they?

652
01:20:02,832 --> 01:20:04,765
They're reliable.

653
01:20:04,767 --> 01:20:06,934
They helped us get here.

654
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:18,813
Oh.

655
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:23,017
Where did you find
such creatures?

656
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:25,186
So soft.

657
01:20:25,188 --> 01:20:29,690
This one has all her teeth.

658
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:33,227
Oh!

659
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:38,332
I can't wait
for them to see it.

660
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:40,901
See?

661
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:42,503
See what?

662
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:43,771
Home.

663
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,577
The green place.

664
01:20:49,579 --> 01:20:54,882
But if you came from the west,
you passed it.

665
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:56,217
The crows.

666
01:20:56,219 --> 01:21:00,187
The creepy place
with all the crows.

667
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,422
The soil.

668
01:21:01,424 --> 01:21:02,823
We had to get out.

669
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:04,692
We had no water and...
The water was filth.

670
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,327
It was poisoned.
It was sour.

671
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:08,028
And the crows came.

672
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,064
We couldn't grow anything.

673
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:11,599
Where are the others?

674
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:13,033
What others?

675
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,401
The many mothers.

676
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,437
We're the only ones left.

677
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:19,166
Look.

678
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:22,736
That's what you call
a satellite.

679
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:25,906
Miss giddy
told us about those.

680
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:29,944
They used to bounce messages
across the earth.

681
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:31,245
Shows.

682
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:34,148
Everyone in the old world
had a show.

683
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:39,486
Do you think there's still
somebody out there?

684
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,522
Sending shows?

685
01:22:41,524 --> 01:22:43,157
Who knows?

686
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:47,594
Those are the plains
of silence.

687
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:50,965
Stay right where you are,
little Joe.

688
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:54,134
Kind of lost its novelty
out here.

689
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,836
You having a baby?

690
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:57,371
Warlord Jr.

691
01:22:57,373 --> 01:22:59,540
Gonna be so ugly.

692
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:01,608
It could be a girl.

693
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:05,045
You kill people with that,
do ya?

694
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:07,147
Killed everyone I ever met
out here.

695
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,349
Headshots, all of 'em.

696
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:10,017
Snap.
Right in the medulla.

697
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:12,219
Thought somehow you girls
were above all that.

698
01:23:15,858 --> 01:23:17,958
Come here.

699
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,700
Take a peek.

700
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:29,837
Seeds.

701
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:31,505
These are from home.

702
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,874
Heirlooms.
The real thing.

703
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:36,210
I plant one
every chance I get.

704
01:23:36,212 --> 01:23:37,578
Where?

705
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,681
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

706
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,983
Ah, so many
different kinds.

707
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:45,319
Trees, flowers, fruit.

708
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:48,389
Back then,
everyone had their fill.

709
01:23:48,391 --> 01:23:51,325
Back then, there was no need
to snap anybody.

710
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,808
Can I talk to you?

711
01:24:27,797 --> 01:24:29,797
I've talked with the others.

712
01:24:36,138 --> 01:24:38,305
We're never gonna have
a better chance

713
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:41,075
to make it across the salt.

714
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:43,077
If we leave the rig here

715
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:46,380
and load the motorcycles up
with as much as we can,

716
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:49,917
we can maybe ride
for 160 days.

717
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:54,621
One of those bikes
is yours.

718
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:57,458
Fully loaded.

719
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:02,129
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

720
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:07,534
I'll... I'll make
my own way.

721
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:16,143
You know,
hope is a mistake.

722
01:25:22,518 --> 01:25:25,519
If you can't fix what's broken,
you'll, uh...

723
01:25:27,857 --> 01:25:29,556
...you'll go insane.

724
01:25:45,207 --> 01:25:47,774
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

725
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:51,111
<i>Where are you?</i>

726
01:25:51,113 --> 01:25:52,346
<i>Help me.</i>

727
01:25:52,348 --> 01:25:55,282
<i>Help us.
You promised to help us.</i>

728
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,694
<i>Come on, pa.
Let's go.</i>

729
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:41,428
All right.

730
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:44,731
This is your way home.

731
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,268
We go back?

732
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,270
Mm.

733
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:51,572
Back?
Yeah.

734
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:54,241
I thought you weren't
insane anymore.

735
01:26:54,243 --> 01:26:55,842
What are they saying?

736
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:58,545
He wants to go back
from where they came.

737
01:26:58,547 --> 01:26:59,880
The citadel.

738
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:02,049
And what's there to find
at the citadel?

739
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:03,250
Green.

740
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:05,619
And water.

741
01:27:05,621 --> 01:27:08,855
There's a ridiculous amount
of clear water.

742
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:10,791
And a lot of crops.

743
01:27:10,793 --> 01:27:13,460
It's got everything you need,
as long as you're not afraid of heights.

744
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:14,861
Where does the water
come from?

745
01:27:14,863 --> 01:27:16,597
He pumps it up
from deep in the earth.

746
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:18,732
Calls it aqua cola
and claims it all for himself.

747
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,268
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

748
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,903
I don't like him already.

749
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,972
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the wall of mountains.

750
01:27:24,974 --> 01:27:26,440
No.

751
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:30,544
I suggest we go back
the same way we came.

752
01:27:30,546 --> 01:27:32,246
Through the canyon.

753
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:35,082
It's open.
We know that. Right?

754
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:37,417
He brought
all his war parties through.

755
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,453
So we take the war rig
and we charge it

756
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:41,488
right through the middle
of them.

757
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:44,324
We can decouple the tanker
at the pass.

758
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:45,959
Shut it off behind us.

759
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:47,327
Kaboom!

760
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:51,999
And how exactly
do we take the citadel?

761
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:55,002
Assuming we're still alive
by then?

762
01:27:55,004 --> 01:27:57,938
If we can block the pass,
it'll be easy.

763
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,940
All that's left
are his war pups

764
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:01,842
and war boys
too sick to fight.

765
01:28:01,844 --> 01:28:04,678
And we'll be with nux.
He's a war boy.

766
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,280
He'll be bringing us home,

767
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:09,082
bringing back what's stolen,
as he's meant to.

768
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:13,754
Yeah.

769
01:28:13,756 --> 01:28:16,790
It feels like hope.

770
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:19,326
I like this plan.

771
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:21,194
We can start again.

772
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:24,131
Just like the old days.

773
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:28,435
Look,
it'll be a hard day.

774
01:28:28,437 --> 01:28:31,638
But I guarantee you
that 160 days ridin' that way,

775
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:36,043
there's nothin' but salt.

776
01:28:36,045 --> 01:28:42,149
At least that way,
you know, we might be able to...

777
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:45,285
Together...

778
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:47,788
Come across
some kind of redemption.

779
01:29:16,919 --> 01:29:19,386
War rig!

780
01:29:19,388 --> 01:29:22,155
That's the war rig!

781
01:29:31,934 --> 01:29:33,033
That's them.

782
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:34,835
Why are they going back?

783
01:29:34,837 --> 01:29:36,770
Do they wish to surrender?

784
01:29:36,772 --> 01:29:39,139
They are heading
for the canyon.

785
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:43,677
They're going back
to the citadel!

786
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,946
They know
it's undefended!

787
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:47,214
Bullocks!

788
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:51,451
Roll up! Roll up!

789
01:29:59,628 --> 01:30:01,428
Go!

790
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:25,218
What are you doing?
Praying.

791
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:28,288
To who?
Anyone that's listening.

792
01:30:51,647 --> 01:30:53,480
Here we go, girls!

793
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,918
That's mine!

794
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:04,558
He'll try to get in front of us,
spike our wheels.

795
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:12,032
Don't blow my engine.

796
01:31:12,034 --> 01:31:13,600
I'm gonna nudge him.

797
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:14,868
Just a little.

798
01:31:27,282 --> 01:31:30,884
You filth!
You traitored him!

799
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:55,675
Go.

800
01:32:20,402 --> 01:32:22,736
Got to back off.

801
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:26,039
Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

802
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,041
Right.

803
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:28,942
Are you a black thumb?

804
01:32:28,944 --> 01:32:30,243
Uh-huh.

805
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:31,778
All right.
Engine one now.

806
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,213
You and me,
fifth wheel.

807
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:34,781
We'll unhook the tanker.

808
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:50,964
One man, one bullet.

809
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:07,147
I cannot see.

810
01:33:07,149 --> 01:33:08,214
Maadi! Maadi!

811
01:33:08,216 --> 01:33:09,549
I cannot see.

812
01:33:29,237 --> 01:33:30,237
Oh!

813
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:49,756
Hey!

814
01:33:49,758 --> 01:33:51,491
Harpoons and plows!

815
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:53,159
They're hauling us back!

816
01:34:03,672 --> 01:34:07,440
Leave three bolts.
Three.

817
01:34:34,736 --> 01:34:36,136
Aah!

818
01:34:43,745 --> 01:34:45,645
Aah!

819
01:35:24,286 --> 01:35:25,485
Hey, you!

820
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:43,236
Are you okay?

821
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,541
I think she's hurt.

822
01:36:10,732 --> 01:36:12,065
Hey!

823
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,026
No!

824
01:36:47,769 --> 01:36:50,637
<i>Hey.</i>

825
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:51,938
<i>Stay with me.</i>

826
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:54,107
<i>- Stay with me.</i>
- Stay with me.

827
01:36:54,109 --> 01:36:55,708
Hey.
Are you there?

828
01:36:57,379 --> 01:36:59,579
You finish that!
I'll finish her!

829
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:31,170
Valhalla!

830
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:43,783
Oi!

831
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:46,653
Aah!

832
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:11,978
Engine one's good.

833
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,813
For now.

834
01:39:23,024 --> 01:39:24,624
Aah!

835
01:40:02,297 --> 01:40:05,298
She's hurt!
She's hurt real bad!

836
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:36,222
You hear that?

837
01:41:36,224 --> 01:41:38,791
We're gonna see
two airborne v-8s.

838
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:42,328
I'm gonna need you
to drive.

839
01:41:43,965 --> 01:41:46,399
I'll get him
out of our way.

840
01:42:52,901 --> 01:42:56,135
Rictus! Take me!

841
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:10,583
Cheedo!

842
01:43:10,585 --> 01:43:13,085
What are you doing?

843
01:43:16,491 --> 01:43:17,823
Aah!
No!

844
01:43:22,497 --> 01:43:24,030
Big boy!

845
01:43:24,032 --> 01:43:25,631
Aah!

846
01:43:30,171 --> 01:43:32,171
Here! Here!

847
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:51,557
Hey!

848
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,825
No!

849
01:44:25,827 --> 01:44:27,226
Remember me?

850
01:44:47,181 --> 01:44:49,615
He's dead!

851
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:51,717
He's dead.

852
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:11,937
When you're across safe,

853
01:45:11,939 --> 01:45:14,273
I'll jam the throttle
and follow you.

854
01:45:14,275 --> 01:45:15,441
Come on!

855
01:45:15,443 --> 01:45:16,676
Hurry!

856
01:45:16,678 --> 01:45:20,246
We're nearly at the pass.

857
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:08,461
Witness me.

858
01:46:13,368 --> 01:46:15,735
Rictus!

859
01:47:10,825 --> 01:47:13,058
Why is she making
that noise?

860
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,960
She's pumping air
into her chest cavity.

861
01:47:14,962 --> 01:47:19,732
She's collapsing her lungs
one breath at a time.

862
01:47:24,272 --> 01:47:25,838
I know.

863
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:30,743
I am so sorry.

864
01:47:31,846 --> 01:47:34,747
I know. I know.

865
01:47:34,749 --> 01:47:37,483
Hold it there.

866
01:47:37,485 --> 01:47:39,685
All right.

867
01:47:39,687 --> 01:47:41,687
Put that on there.
Press it on.

868
01:47:41,689 --> 01:47:42,689
Hey.

869
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:44,256
Hey.

870
01:47:44,258 --> 01:47:46,091
Home.

871
01:47:52,767 --> 01:47:55,067
Home.

872
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:00,973
N-no.

873
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:02,174
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

874
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,209
She's exsanguinated.

875
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:04,777
Drained all her blood.

876
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:07,379
Hold these.

877
01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:09,849
We need that.
Thank you.

878
01:48:09,851 --> 01:48:11,484
Needle.

879
01:48:11,486 --> 01:48:13,185
Come on!

880
01:48:13,187 --> 01:48:15,254
Take this.

881
01:48:17,525 --> 01:48:19,191
Keep her awake.

882
01:48:19,193 --> 01:48:21,427
Furiosa.

883
01:48:24,999 --> 01:48:28,000
Okay,
that's not retracting.

884
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:29,368
There we go.

885
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:33,138
All right, hold it up.
Hold it up.

886
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:34,306
Okay.

887
01:48:34,308 --> 01:48:35,708
Sorry.

888
01:48:37,645 --> 01:48:39,512
There you go. Okay.

889
01:48:39,514 --> 01:48:41,046
There you go.

890
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,493
Max.

891
01:48:54,495 --> 01:48:56,929
My name is Max.

892
01:49:04,939 --> 01:49:07,506
That's my name.

893
01:49:48,883 --> 01:49:50,115
Brake!

894
01:49:55,456 --> 01:49:57,056
Reveal yourself.

895
01:50:16,077 --> 01:50:17,509
He's got something.

896
01:50:24,619 --> 01:50:26,318
It's immortan Joe.

897
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,488
The immortan Joe is dead!

898
01:50:54,782 --> 01:50:56,949
Furiosa!

899
01:50:56,951 --> 01:50:58,050
Furiosa!

900
01:50:58,052 --> 01:50:59,184
Furiosa!

901
01:50:59,186 --> 01:51:00,886
Furiosa!

902
01:51:00,888 --> 01:51:02,655
Furiosa!

903
01:51:02,657 --> 01:51:05,391
She's back.

904
01:51:13,968 --> 01:51:15,801
Let's do it!

905
01:51:15,803 --> 01:51:17,469
Let 'em up.
Come on.

905
